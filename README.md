# Poverty-Alimentary-Poverty-in-Mexico

## Author: Diego Daniel Munoz Batista

## Description:

Data Visualizations of poverty in Mexico using CONEVAL's data (Mexican institution that estimates poverty at state and county level). The datasets already have an estimation of different types of poverty and boolean variables to indicate carencies in Mexican households. Datasets for years: 2016, 2018,2020, and 2022; each year has around 250,000 rows and each row has a factor of expansion (each row is a household). Source: https://www.coneval.org.mx/Medicion/MP/Paginas/Programas_BD_2022.aspx

The main goal is to identificate the states in most need and what are the main charecteristics that are driving the poverty there.

## Questions:

I would like to find more variables that would be nice to correlate with poverty, can you think of any? The datasets already have variables such as education level or wheteher the house has underage individuals or not. I would like to include more demographic variables or state performance variables, but Mexico use to lack that data type.
